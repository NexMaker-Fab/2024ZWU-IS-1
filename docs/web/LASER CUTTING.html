            <p> </p>
            <h2>1. Learn how to keep safety</h2>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Selection and use of laser protective glasses: </p>
            <p>Make sure to use protective glasses that are appropriate for the type and power of the laser, usually labeled with the type of laser and level of protection applicable. </p>
            <p>And ensure that the protective glasses are not damaged or worn during use, and replace the damaged protective glasses in time. </p>
            <p>Inspection and use of equipment safety features: </p>
            <p>Test the function of the emergency stop button before each operation. These buttons are usually located in an easily accessible part of the operating area to quickly stop the device in case of an emergency. </p>
            <p>Ensure that the laser cutting equipment's protective cover is intact and properly installed. The shield can effectively reduce the direct exposure of laser radiation to the operator. </p>
            <p>Security Settings for the operation area: </p>
            <p>Place the laser cutting equipment on a stable workbench and ensure that the equipment is level to avoid accidents caused by shaking or tilting the equipment. </p>
            <p>Set up an appropriate working space in the operation area and ensure that there is no debris or obstacles around to prevent the operator from tripping or bumping into the equipment. </p>
            <p>Waste disposal and soot control: </p>
            <p>Use effective exhaust system and smoke extraction equipment to quickly discharge smoke and harmful gases from the operating area to keep the air fresh and the health and safety of the operator. </p>
            <p>Clean equipment and operating areas regularly, especially where waste and by-products accumulate, to avoid the risk of dust or carbon buildup. </p>
            <p>Emergency response and preparedness measures: </p>
            <p>Place clearly marked first aid kits and eye douches near the operation area and ensure that all operators know their location and how to use them. </p>
            <p>Develop and practice an emergency evacuation plan, including how to safely shut down equipment and leave the operation area. </p>
