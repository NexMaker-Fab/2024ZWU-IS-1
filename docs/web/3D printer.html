            <h4>Standardization of 3d printing in the medical field</h4>
            <p> </p>
            <p>China's Medical Device Production supervision and Management Measures list the safety and effectiveness of medical devices as the primary requirements. Currently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) relies primarily on sound decisions and valid scientific evidence to control risks and ensure that medical products can be used safely and effectively to improve public health. For new medical devices in the field of additive manufacturing, the corresponding regulatory science needs to be established to verify the performance of registered products. Important tasks to be completed before registration include conducting multi-center clinical trials and medical studies, as well as producing products that have been summarized and peer-reviewed and published through scientific publications to provide an important basis for clinical practice. This type of research and production will facilitate the development of innovative products and facilitate the monitoring of the entire use process during the clinical application of the product.</p>

            <p>1980s: During this period, 3D printing technology began to take off. Early 3D printers used photocuring technology, which uses ultraviolet light to cure liquid photosensitive materials to stack objects layer by layer. </p>
            <p>1990s: With the development of technology, more 3D printing technology appeared. For example, selective laser sintering (SLS) technology uses a laser beam to burn a powder material into a solid object. In addition, inkjet printing technology has also emerged, which can be printed using a variety of materials. </p>
            <p>2000s: 3D printing technology is widely used. Traditional 3D printing technology is maturing, while new technologies such as multi-beam laser sintering (MJF) and electron beam melting (EBM) have emerged, which improve printing speed and quality. </p>
            <p>In recent years: 3D printing technology has received greater breakthroughs and innovations. For example, bioprinting technology has emerged, which can print tissues, organs and other biomedical applications; Metal 3D printing technology has also been rapidly developed, can print complex metal parts; At the same time, multi-material printing and multi-color printing have also become a reality.             </p>
