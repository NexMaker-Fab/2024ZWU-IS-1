            <h5>The rise of 3D printing technology in the biomedical field</h5>
            <p>Background </p>
            <p>1. The demand for personalized medicine is growing, and traditional medical solutions are difficult to meet individual differences. 3D printing can customize accurately adapted products and solutions. </p>
            <p>2. The development of medical imaging, such as CT and MRI, can provide high-precision anatomical data for 3D printing and facilitate the creation of accurate models. </p>
            <p>3. Innovation in material science, new biocompatible and degradable materials support the printing of devices and stents that better meet the requirements of the human body. </p>
            <p>4. Progress in bioengineering and cell biology research to provide theoretical basis and possibility for printing tissues and organs. </p>
            <p>5. Society's rising expectations for medical quality have prompted the industry to explore innovative technologies to improve outcomes and quality. </p>
            <p>Multidisciplinary collaborative development and medical needs have jointly promoted the application and research of 3D printing in the biomedical field. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>3D printing technology in the field of biomedical applications </p>
            <p>• Medical models and surgical planning: </p>
            <p>3D printing technology can be used to create patient-specific anatomical models to help doctors with surgical planning and simulation, improving the accuracy and success rate of surgery.</p>
            <p>• Implants and prosthetics:</p>
            <p>3D printing can make personalized implants and prostheses, such as orthopedic implants, dental restorations, etc., to better fit the patient's anatomy. </p>
            <p>• Tissue Engineering and organ printing:</p>
            <p>The technology can be used to build tissue engineering scaffolds that provide an environment for cells to grow and differentiate, promoting tissue regeneration. In addition, scientists are also working to explore the possibility of 3D printing organs. </p>
            <p>• Drug development:</p>
            <p>3D printing can be used to create drug dosage forms, such as controlled release tablets or microspheres, to enable personalized drug therapy. </p>
            <p>• Medical devices and tools: </p>
            <p>3D printing can be used to manufacture various medical devices and tools, such as surgical instruments, prosthetics, etc., to improve their performance and applicability. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Specific application cases of 3D printing technology in the biomedical field:</p>
            <p>• 3D printed organs: </p>
            <p>On March 26, 2023, a research team from the Catholic University of Korea successfully implanted the world's first 3D bioprinted artificial trachea into a patient, customized using another person's adult stem cells. The team performed the transplant on a woman in her 50s who had lost part of her windpipe after undergoing surgery for thyroid cancer. The operation took place in August last year, and after six months of follow-up observation, it was confirmed that the trachea was successfully implanted. </p>

            <p>• 3D printed bones:</p>
            <p>Through the 3D printer can be printed to replace the human bone titanium "bone", compared with the traditional metal bone, 3D printed "bone" not only the size is very accurate, but also with the pores for bone growth, adjacent bones will enter the pores during the growth process, so that the real bone and false bone firmly formed a body, so that the patient's recovery period is shortened.</p>

            <p>Standardization of 3d printing in the medical field</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>China's Medical Device Production supervision and Management Measures list the safety and effectiveness of medical devices as the primary requirements. Currently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) relies primarily on sound decisions and valid scientific evidence to control risks and ensure that medical products can be used safely and effectively to improve public health. For new medical devices in the field of additive manufacturing, the corresponding regulatory science needs to be established to verify the performance of registered products. Important tasks to be completed before registration include conducting multi-center clinical trials and medical studies, as well as producing products that have been summarized and peer-reviewed and published through scientific publications to provide an important basis for clinical practice. This type of research and production will facilitate the development of innovative products and facilitate the monitoring of the entire use process during the clinical application of the product.</p>
