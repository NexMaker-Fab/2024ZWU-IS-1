            <p>Wood painting </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Wood painting is a common post-treatment that protects the surface of the wood and increases the beauty and durability of the wood. Here are the general steps for painting wood: </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>1. Surface preparation: Ensure that the surface of the wood is clean and smooth, free of dust, grease or other contaminants. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>2. Primer coating: Select a primer suitable for wood, and use a brush or spray gun to evenly paint the wood surface. Primer can help enhance the adhesion and durability of the paint. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>3. Sanding: After the primer has dried, gently sand the surface of the wood using sandpaper to remove any bristles or uneven areas. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>4. Finish painting: Select the desired color of finish paint and use a brush or spray gun to evenly paint on the wood surface. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>5. Drying and curing: Let the paint dry and cure in a well-ventilated environment. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>The exact steps and methods of painting may vary depending on the type of wood, the type of paint, and the individual's needs. Before painting the wood, it is best to read the instructions and recommendations of the paint product and make appropriate adjustments according to the actual situation. </p>

            <h4>4.UV glue</h4>
            <p> </p>
            <p>When we make the algae tank shell, we use UV glue to connect the acrylic, for the following reasons: </p>
            <p>Fast curing: UV adhesive can cure quickly under ultraviolet light, curing time is usually between a few seconds to a few minutes, with the characteristics of instant bonding. </p>
            <p>Solvent-free: UV glue does not contain organic solvents, will not release harmful gases after curing, in line with environmental requirements. </p>
            <p>High transparency: The transparency of UV adhesive curing is very high, similar to the transparency of glass, suitable for visually traceless bonding needs. </p>
            <p>Excellent bonding strength: After UV adhesive curing, its bonding strength is very high, and it can firmly bond various materials, including glass, metal, plastic, ceramics and so on.  </p>
            <p>Temperature resistance and chemical resistance: cured UV adhesive usually has good temperature resistance and chemical resistance, and can resist high temperature and the erosion of some chemicals within a certain range. </p>
            <p>Easy to control: UV glue can flexibly control the curing time and curing position during use, which is convenient for precise operation and production automation. </p>
