            <h2>Arduino Input</h2>
            <h4>AD8232 Ecg sensor</h4>
            <h4>1 introduction</h4>
            <p>Project introduction:</p>
            <p>The uno board is connected to the ad8232, and then the electrode is connected to obtain the heart rate through Arduino.</p>
            <p>  </p>
            <p><a href="https://m.tb.cn/h.gVjB01DoJfqzTzY?tk=r6v3WDShxeC" style="color:#FF0000">AD832</a> introductionï¼š  </p>
            <p>The AD8232 is a single-lead heart rate monitoring front end with integrated front end, which is suitable for heart rate monitoring by signal conditioning of cardiac bioelectrical signals.  </p>
            <p>The AD8232 uses a double-pole high-pass filter to eliminate moving artifacts and electrode half-cell potentials. The filter is closely integrated with the structure of the instrument amplifier, which can realize single-stage high-gain and high-pass filtering, saving space and cost.  </p>
            <p>The AD8232 uses a no-use constraint operational amplifier to create a three-pole low-pass filter, eliminating additional noise. Users can choose the cut-off frequency of all filters to meet the needs of different types of applications.  </p>
            <p>To improve common mode rejection of system line frequencies and other undesirable disturbances, the AD8232 has a built-in amplifier for driven lead applications such as right hand drive (RLD).  </p>
            <p>The AD8232 includes a fast recovery feature that reduces the long build tail of the high-pass filter.  </p>
            <p>If there is a signal change in the amplifier rail voltage (such as lead disconnection), the AD8232 automatically adjusts to a higher filter cut-off state. This feature allows the AD8232 to achieve fast recovery so that a valid measurement value can be obtained as soon as possible after the lead is connected to the electrode of the measurement object.  </p>
